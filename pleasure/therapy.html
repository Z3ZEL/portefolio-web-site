            Welcome to our game called “Therapy“ ! We are a group of high schoolers in senior year trying to have fun developing a game all together in spite of the quarantine. This is our first time developing a game and participing to this kind of event and we are really proud of the outcome of it !

            This game is made for the 46th Ludum Dare as theme ‘Keep It Alive‘ and since we are all in the scientific pathway, we made a game related to science !

            <p class="description" >In our game you’re a kind of ‘antibody’ coming out of a liquid injected to a person with a syringe, the goal is to survive, to keep it alive as you can guess ! It’s goal is to save that person from an unknown virus by destroying the differents infected cells in
                 the body. We don’t wanna spoil you anything about what’s in our game but we would really appreciate to have a critical feedback !
